    <h2 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">A modern web-based music player inspired by the Microsoft Zune, built for control, nostalgia, and personal expression.</h2>

    <p>Music Found is a self-hosted music player designed to let you manage and enjoy your collection your way. Upload your music, customize metadata, organize playlists, and associate visuals—album art, GIFs, or video clips—to create a richer listening experience. With an integrated EQ, waveform visualization, and a secure API for future expansion, it's a passion project bridging the gap between nostalgia and modern web tech.</p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-medium mt-2">Why I Built This</h2>
    <p>I wanted more than just a playlist scrubber. I missed the tactile feel of organizing music visually—the way Zune's UI celebrated album art and discovery. Streaming services don't always respect how I associate sounds with memories, visuals, or even specific EQ settings. Music Found is my answer: a place to tweak metadata, boost bass for hip-hop, crisp up vocals for jazz, or pair a song with a GIF that captures its vibe.</p>
